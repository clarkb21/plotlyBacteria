# Bellybutton Biodiversity Plotly Challenge


## Purpose
- The purpose of this task was to create interactive charts where the users of the webpage could dynamically change them by selecting from a dropdown menu.
- Bar charts, bubble charts, pie charts, gauge charts, and scatter plots were all used using the Plotly library and Javascript. 

## Project Overview
- Using Javascript, I updated the HTML code to allow for users to select their own ID from a dropdown menu. In turn, the webpage would display informtion and show interactive charts about bacteria samples specifically for them. 
- The charts show what types of bacteria were found, and also how much of each sample were found in their naval.

### Challenge Overview
- The challenge also had us show a gauge chart for the number of times per week each participant washed their belly buttons. 
- The last part of the challenge was to practice using CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML to customize the webpage. I changed colors of the text and background, added a navigation bar, and also added a background image.

## Results
- The results for my work are published on my Github pages site where users can access the data, find their specific ID number, and analyze the charts for bacteria found in their specific bodies.
